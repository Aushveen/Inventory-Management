# Shopify-Backend-Intern-Challenge

This is my web application, coded fully in Java.
In order to use it, simply run the application and then follow the instructions displayed!
The application is not case sensitive --> for example, you can type in Ball as the item, and if you want to edit it and you need to find the item, you can 
type bAlL and it will retrieve that same item you created early to add to inventory.
The additional feature I added was the shipping feature.
Overall, it is a simple application to use and is very easy to navigate through.
If you have any questions or need any clarification on the code, I have added comments in the .java files which should be able to help out.
Thank you, and I hope you enjoy!!
